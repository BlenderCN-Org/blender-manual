Hair Dynamics
=============

Hair particles can now be made dynamic using Cloth physics.

Settings
========


Material
--------

:guilabel:`Stiffness`
   Controls how stiff the root of the hair strands are.
:guilabel:`Mass`
   Controls the mass of the cloth material.
:guilabel:`Bending`
   Controls the amount of bend along the hairs. Higher values cause less bending.
:guilabel:`Internal Friction`
   Amount of friction between individual hairs.
:guilabel:`Collider Friction`
   Amount of friction between hairs and external collision objects.


Damping
-------

:guilabel:`Spring`
   Damping of cloth velocity. (higher = more smooth, less jiggling).
:guilabel:`Air`
   Air has normally some thickness which slows falling things down.


Quality
-------

:guilabel:`Steps`
   Quality of the simulation in steps per frame. (higher is better quality but slower).
