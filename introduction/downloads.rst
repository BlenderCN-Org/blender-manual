Downloadable versions of this manual
====================================

While the official documentation is created and maintained in this wiki,
which always contains the latest contributions,
it could be useful for someone to have a downloadable form of the wiki manual content
(such as PDF format or others).

To address this need,
users started creating **unofficial** versions of the wiki manual content:


- Unofficial conversion of the wiki manual, in PDF format
  - available from this page: `https://archive.org/details/BlenderWikiPDFManual <https://archive.org/details/BlenderWikiPDFManual>`__
  - more details available from the download page

  - last update: 2014-05-06
  - PDF size: ~44MB, ~1500 pages (english wiki version)
  - other languages: JA, ET, RO, DE, ES, CZ
