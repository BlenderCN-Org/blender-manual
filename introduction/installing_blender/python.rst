`Python <http://www.python.org>`__ is an interpreted programming language used in Blender as our main general purpose scripting language.

Python can be used to extend the functionality of Blender with regular installations available
from the `Blender download <http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/>`__ page.
Blender comes bundled with the appropriate Python libraries, so,
for regular usage a full install of Python is not required to run Python scripts.


Users wanting to :doc:`write their own scripts <extensions/python>`\ ,
FIXME(Link Type Unsupported: dev;
[[Dev:Doc/Building_Blender|compile their own versions of Blender]]
) or use some less common features may still need a full Python install.

Users that want full Python functionality should refer to the `Python <http://www.python.org>`__
website for installation instructions.
