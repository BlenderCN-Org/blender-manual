   Lamp panel with the light affecting options highlighted


Every lamp has a set of switches that control which objects receive its light,
and how it interacts with materials.

:guilabel:`Negative`
   The light produced by the lamp is **subtracted** from the one "available" on the surfaces it hits, which darkens these surfaces instead of brightening them.

:guilabel:`This Layer Only`
   Causes the lamp to only light objects on the same layer.

:guilabel:`Diffuse`
   Prevents the lamp from producing :doc:`diffuse light </materials/properties/diffuse_shaders>` (it doesn't really "light" things).

:guilabel:`Specular`
   Prevents the lamp from producing :doc:`specular highlights </materials/properties/specular_shaders>`.
