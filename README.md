TODO
====

Cleanup:
- Replace all instances of 'nicetip' with the '.. tip::' directive.
- Replace some unnecessary tables with bullets - eg: 'render/output/video.rst:220'
- FIXME(Link Type Unsupported: ... we have a lot of these, could automate fixes.
- There are links into http://wiki.blender.org, these need to be corrected
- Fix titles, allowing only one h1 per file (clearer menu structure)


Conventions:
- Choose a way to reference UI elements, ':guilabel:' is used all over, but may want to just use bold/italic.
- lots of lines over 120 length (low priority)
